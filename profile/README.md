## We are Team SOBITS

SOBITS is an AI Robotics laboratory team based at the [Faculty of Science and Engineering](https://www.soka.ac.jp/en/academics/guideline/science) of [Soka University Japan](https://www.soka.ac.jp/en/). Formally consolidated in 2010, we have been striving on both software and hardware with a mindset that values self-development, humanistic principles, and the pursuit of happiness.

In our laboratory, we conduct daily research and development aiming to realize a more humanistic society through the "coexistenceâ€‹ of robots for the people". As part of our mission, we participate regularly in [RoboCup @Home](https://athome.robocup.org/), a life-support robot competition, to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of robots to keep advancing in its development. 

So far, we have built up robots such as [SOBIT PRO](https://github.com/TeamSOBITS/sobit_pro), [SOBIT EDU](https://github.com/TeamSOBITS/sobit_edu) or [SOBIT MINI](https://github.com/TeamSOBITS/sobit_mini), and contributed to innovative technology that aims to support and improve the quality of life of people. In that sense, SOBITS takes "communication in the laboratory" as an indispensable and powerful tool towards our researching projects.
